Getting Started
To get the application running locally, you need to set up both the backend and frontend environments.

Prerequisites
Node.js (>= v14.0.0)
MongoDB (locally or using MongoDB Atlas)
NPM (Node Package Manager)

1. Clone the Repository
   bash
   Copy code
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fullstack-quiz-app.git
   cd fullstack-quiz-app
2. Backend Setup
   Navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend folder and add the following environment variables:

bash
Copy code
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/quizapp
Run the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup
   Navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Update the backend API URL in frontend/src/config.js (if needed):

js
Copy code
export const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api';
Start the React application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Running Both Applications
You can run both the backend and frontend simultaneously using two separate terminal windows:

In the first terminal, navigate to the backend folder and run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
In the second terminal, navigate to the frontend folder and run:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Deployment
Backend Deployment
The backend can be deployed to platforms like Heroku or AWS. Ensure that the MongoDB URI in your .env file is updated to point to a production database, such as MongoDB Atlas.

Frontend Deployment
The frontend can be deployed to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or a static file server. Ensure that the API URL in frontend/src/config.js points to the deployed backend server.

Technologies Used
Backend:
Node.js with Express: Backend framework
MongoDB: NoSQL database using Mongoose for schema-based data modeling
JWT: For user authentication
dotenv: Environment variable management
Frontend:
React.js: Frontend UI framework
Axios: For making API requests
React Router: For navigation and routing between different pages
CSS/Bootstrap: For styling the application
